# JP-Morgan-Chase-Co.-Virtual-Internship-2020
Welcome to the Software Engineering Virtual Experience  You’re going to assist with some development of an alternative way to visualize and analyze share price data for our traders – this will alert them of potential trading opportunities.  JPMorgan Chase has traders in all the major financial centers and creates a marketplace for asset classes around the globe for our investor clients. Trading teams are organized by asset class:  Equities (stocks) Commodities Credit (debt and bonds) Currency &amp; Emerging Markets Public Finance (Government bonds) Interest rates Securitized Products For this project, a trader from the equities team (publicly listed company stocks) has requested functionality be added to their dashboard to allow them to input specific information so they can monitor a new trading strategy.  In order to do this, you’ll need to set up your system so you can interface with the relevant financial data feed, make the required calculations and then present this in a way that allows the traders to visualize and analyze this data in real time.   The visualization of charts and data analysis our trader’s see is all built on JPMorgan Chase's own open sourced software called Perspective. You’ll learn how to implement this to facilitate the trader’s requested changes and deliver actionable insights.  You’ll have to gain an understanding of the user requirements and then build something that meets those requirements.
